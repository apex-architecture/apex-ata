# APEX-ATA

APEX-ATA is an open, neutral, machine-readable format for recording
AI computation attestations.

It defines how facts about an AI computation are written down —
not how they are judged.
## Status

Frozen reference schema.

No roadmap.  
No planned changes.  
Published as-is for reference use.

## What This Is

- A structured receipt for AI computations
- A provenance and audit trail format
- A technical reference for compliance workflows
- A neutral schema usable across jurisdictions

## What This Is NOT

- A certification
- A compliance guarantee
- A safety judgment
- A regulatory approval
- An enforcement mechanism

## Design Principles

- Non-evaluative
- Human- and machine-readable
- Jurisdiction-agnostic
- Compatible with regulatory documentation
- Safe to reference by auditors and regulators

## Intended Use

APEX-ATA may be used to record:

- Model identifiers
- Input and output hashes
- Execution timestamps
- Human-in-the-loop declarations
- Declared risk classifications

The format records **claims**, not truth.
Verification is explicitly out of scope.
